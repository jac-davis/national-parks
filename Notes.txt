class Rank:

Methods:
1. Method that creates a rank from a blog. This will basically clean the blog so it is ready to be analyzed.
2. Method that adds the results from that blog to the main rank.
3. You can either use a for loop to do this through all of the blogs in a csv file
4. Or you can pick and choose which blogs you want to be as a part of the rank.

Future Functionality/game idea:
- I can make it a game where you get points not for how many national parks you visit, but the more obscure ones are worth more points.


WAY Advanced functionality:
- get it to use a map and calculate the distance to each park.


IDEA!
- Make a national parks scrapbook app that let's you add a picture for the main hikes/activities in the park. 
- so each park is an instance, and then you can add hikes per park and add pictures per park.
- Hikes have different point values depending on the distance and elevation rating.
- Can compete with friends to get the most points and document all your hikes along the way.
- you can add additional hikes outside of national parks as bonus points if you want.
- bonus points if you hit certain milestones of certain # of parks visited.
- bonus points for how many you visited in a certain time frame.
- ability to upload to something like chatbooks and print a sort of scrapbook for your adventures.
