Future Functionality(low_level):
1. Add a class for the get_average_rank function that lets you have an easier input. Instead of having to call the
get_dict function first, let you input like just the blog names from the first column in the csv file.


Hike/National Park Tracking App:
- I can make it a game where you get points. Ways to get points:
1. Visiting a park 
2. Completing a hike in a park (points calculated by difficulty [ex: distance and elevation])
3. Badges for hiking certain distance, certain number of hikes, certain num of parks visited
- Each park visit and hike lets you add photos, and you can upload them to a scrapbook app and print a book (kind of like chatbooks)

- Create a park class, and then a hike class within it. Each park is an instance, and then you can add hikes per park and add pictures per hike.

WAY Advanced functionality:
- get it to use a map and calculate the distance to each park.
